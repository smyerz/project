                    <h3>About Us:</h3><br>
                    <h6>Based in Madison, Wisconsin, Hair Day is a boutique hair salon 
                    that specializes in cut, color and styling. Hair Day also offers 
                    makeup and nail services, prides itself on its warm and relaxing 
                    atmosphere and is best known for edgy hair colors and on-trend cuts.
                     The salon can only accommodate a small number of coloring
                      appointments each week, so clients need to book far in advance.
                       To keep clients inspired between appointments, the employees 
                       share makeup and nail tutorials on the Hair Day website.</h6><br>
                    <h6>Pria, the owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist 
                    and immediately started specializing in edgy, custom coloring techniques. 
                     She wanted to create a "treat yourself" environment for her clients.
                      Pria opened the salon with her good friend and talented hairdresser, 
                      Garry. They have a staff of seven: two stylists, three colorists,
                       one manicurist and one make-up artist.</h6>
